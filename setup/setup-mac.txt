May need to install XQuartz to solve 'Xvfb' issues:
https://www.xquartz.org/
If you can't run 'Xvfb -help' after installation, try running from the XQuartz terminal:
Applications > Utilities > XQuartz > Right Click in Dock > Terminal

If you run into problems, try using sudo to install with pip + for running Python.
If you get Selenium problems when running as sudo, try 'sudo su' to change to the root user, then run as root.
